# Pre-work - Tipper

Tipper is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Steve Buza

Time spent: 25 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Added a split bill option in settings.
- [x] Added a custom tip option in settings.
- [x] Added a label that shows the current tip percentage
- [x] Added a label that shows the current split number
- [x] Added a Cogwheel button to segue from the TipsViewController to the SettingsViewController

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Learning how to use optionals. 

Having ideas that I didn't know how to implement.

Working with the navigation controller was a bit difficult until I coded it.
